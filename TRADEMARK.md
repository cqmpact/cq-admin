# Name and Logo Usage Policy for cq-admin

This document describes permitted and prohibited uses of the **cq-admin** project name and related branding to help avoid confusion about origin, affiliation, or endorsement.

The code in this repository is licensed under the **Mozilla Public License 2.0 (MPL-2.0)** (see `LICENSE`). **Project name, logos, icons, and other brand elements are not granted under the MPL-2.0 license** and are covered by this policy.

## Scope

This policy applies to use of the **cq-admin** name and any **cq-admin** logos/icons/wordmarks that appear in this repository (collectively, the “Project Branding”).

References to third-party names or logos in this repository may be the property of their respective owners and are governed by their own policies.

## Principles

- Do not use Project Branding in a way that suggests **endorsement, sponsorship, or official affiliation** with the cq-admin maintainers.
- You may use the project name to make **truthful, factual statements** (e.g., “compatible with cq-admin” or “plugin for cq-admin”) as long as you do not create confusion about origin.
- Where practical, use the project name as an adjective (e.g., “cq-admin resource”) rather than as a noun/verb.

## Permitted uses (no prior permission required)

- Descriptive references to the project name in text (documentation, articles, tutorials, reviews).
- Compatibility statements such as “works with cq-admin,” “for cq-admin,” or “based on cq-admin,” provided:
    - your own product/brand name is more prominent, and
    - you do not imply endorsement or official status.
- Links to the official repository or other official project channels.
- Distribution of **unmodified** copies of this repository, including the cq-admin name and notices, as long as the distribution is the original project.

## Forks and modified distributions

You may fork this project.

If you **distribute** a modified version (including publishing it, bundling it for others, or selling access to the modified code), you must:

1. **Use a different name** for your distribution (do not call it `cq-admin`).
2. **Remove or replace cq-admin logos/icons/branding** in the UI and in marketing materials for your distribution.
3. **Clearly identify your work as an unofficial fork**, for example:
    - “Unofficial fork of cq-admin”
    - “Based on cq-admin (unofficial)”

You may still make truthful statements such as “compatible with cq-admin” or “based on cq-admin,” provided those statements are not misleading and do not imply endorsement.

## Not permitted without prior permission

- Using `cq-admin` (or a confusingly similar name) as the name of your product, service, organization, or domain in a way that suggests it is the official project.

## Suggested attribution language

When referencing the project in your own materials, you may include:

> “This project is not affiliated with or endorsed by the cq-admin maintainers. ‘cq-admin’ is used for identification only.”

## Questions and permission requests

If you want to use the project name or branding in ways not covered above, please open an issue in this repository (or contact the maintainers through the project’s official channels) describing your intended use.

## Changes to this policy

This policy may be updated over time. Changes will be reflected in the repository history.
